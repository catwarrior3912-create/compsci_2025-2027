# Week 01 - Welcome

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Onur Onat SÃ¼rmeli, a Full-Stack Web Developer, and your IB DP Computer Science teacher.
This is my first time teaching in a school (most of my teaching experience is from training interns), and I'm looking forward to sharing my knowledge and passion for technology with all of you.

## What To Expect

We'll be starting from the scratch and gradually build up to more complex topics as the year progresses. There will be a few computer games that I'll recommend for you to play to improve your computational thinking, problem solving, and programming skills. I'll also try to get you free Steam keys for some of these games, but can't promise anything since it'll be based on the cooperation of the game developers.

**A starter list of games:**

- **Factorio:** Amazing for understanding resource management in computers and understanding bottle-neck issues, and learn about buses.
- **Baba Is You:** Great for learning about logic and programming concepts through a unique puzzle format. Helps with understanding of how rules impact behavior.
- **The Witness:** Excellent for developing problem-solving skills and understanding complex systems. Especially great for pattern recognition, and out-of-the-box thinking.

## Course Structure

We'll start from B2 (Programming Fundamentals) and continue onward with B1 (Computational Thinking) and B3 (Object-Oriented Programming). This section should be interactive and engaging, with plenty of opportunities for hands-on practice and collaboration. Starting with programming should give you some understanding of the fundamental concepts that underpin all areas of computer science. B2 will be before B1 to establish a solid foundation in programming concepts before diving into the logic behind how we think while programming.

From there on, we'll move onto A3 (Databases), which will closely relate to the previous programming topics, while adding a rigid structure to our understanding of data management and manipulation.

These topics, with the Internal Assessment project, will take up most of your first year. If there seems to be a need for more time on any of these subjects, we can adjust the schedule accordingly to ensure everyone is comfortable with the material before moving on.

In the second year, we'll cover A1 (Computer Fundamentals) to learn more about the inner workings of the computer systems and how software interacts with hardware. After that, we'll go into A2 (Networks) to understand how computers communicate with each other and the internet. Finally, we'll wrap up with A4 (Machine Learning) to learn how to implement modern machine learning techniques and discuss the ethics of AI.

## Resources

Resources will be made available on Google Classroom, Managebac and also in Github Classroom(if I can set it up properly). I will also try to keep this document up to date, but it may not always reflect the most current information. If you see something missing, feel free to create an issue on the repository.
